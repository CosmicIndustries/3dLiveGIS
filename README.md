const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('New client connected');
  
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
    // Process incoming messages and broadcast to clients
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Integrating Data Processing and Visualization

**src/components/Visualization.js** (updated):
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

const Visualization = () => {
  const socket = useRef(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000');
    socket.current.onmessage = (message) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
      setData(data);
    };

    return () => socket.current.close();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <OrbitControls />
      {/* Use the data state to create 3D visualization */}
      {data && data.map((point, index) => (
        <mesh key={index} position={[point.x, point.y, point.z]}>
          <sphereBufferGeometry args={[0.1, 32, 32]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color='red' />
        </mesh>
      ))}
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default Visualization;
```

npm install react react-dom three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
npm install express socket.io
npm install aws-sdk
npm install tensorflow @tensorflow/tfjs
npm install -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

3. **Set Up Project Structure**:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components src/utils src/styles public
```

### Basic Project Structure

**src/index.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';
import './styles/index.css';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**src/components/App.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Visualization from './Visualization';
import CustomizationPanel from './CustomizationPanel';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>16K Weather Visualization</h1>
      <CustomizationPanel />
      <Visualization />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**src/components/Visualization.js**:
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';
import { WebSocket } from 'ws';

const Visualization = () => {
  const socket = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000');
    socket.current.onmessage = (message) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
      // Process and update visualization with data
    };

    return () => socket.current.close();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <OrbitControls />
      {/* Add 3D visualization components here */}
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default Visualization;
```

**src/components/CustomizationPanel.js**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const CustomizationPanel = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [colorScheme, setColorScheme] = useState('default');
  const [dataThreshold, setDataThreshold] = useState(50);
  const [animationSpeed, setAnimationSpeed] = useState(1);

  const handleColorSchemeChange = (event) => {
    setColorScheme(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_COLOR_SCHEME', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  const handleDataThresholdChange = (event) => {
    setDataThreshold(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_DATA_THRESHOLD', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  const handleAnimationSpeedChange = (event) => {
    setAnimationSpeed(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_ANIMATION_SPEED', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  return (
    <div className="customization-panel">
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="color-scheme-select">Color Scheme:</label>
        <select id="color-scheme-select" value={colorScheme} onChange={handleColorSchemeChange}>
          <option value="default">Default</option>
          <option value="cool">Cool</option>
          <option value="warm">Warm</option>
          {/* Add more color schemes */}
        </select>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="data-threshold-input">Data Threshold:</label>
        <input
          id="data-threshold-input"
          type="number"
          value={dataThreshold}
          onChange={handleDataThresholdChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="animation-speed-input">Animation Speed:</label>
        <input
          id="animation-speed-input"
          type="number"
          value={animationSpeed}
          onChange={handleAnimationSpeedChange}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomizationPanel;
```

**src/styles/index.css**:
```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.customization-panel {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.customization-panel > div {
  margin: 0 10px;
}
```

### Webpack and Babel Configuration

**webpack.config.js**:
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
};
```

**.babelrc**:
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

**public/index.html**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>16K Weather Visualization</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Running the Project

1. **Build and Start the Project**:
   - Add scripts to your `package.json` to build and start the project.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

You should now have a basic setup for your 16K weather visualization project. Next, we can start integrating more specific functionalities such as data processing, WebSocket communication, and advanced visualization techniques.

     }

     .customization-panel > div {
       margin: 0 10px;
     }
     ```

4. **Webpack and Babel Configuration**:
   - **webpack.config.js**:
     ```javascript
     const path = require('path');
     const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

     module.exports = {
       entry: './src/index.js',
       output: {
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
         filename: 'bundle.js',
       },
       module: {
         rules: [
           {
             test: /\.js$/,
             exclude: /node_modules/,
             use: {
               loader: 'babel-loader',
             },
           },
           {
             test: /\.css$/,
             use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
           },
         ],
       },
       plugins: [
         new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
           template: './public/index.html',
         }),
       ],
       devGreat! Let's start refactoring the project by organizing it into a clear structure and implementing the key components step-by-step. We will follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Project**
2. **Install Dependencies**
3. **Set Up Project Structure**
4. **Configure Webpack and Babel**
5. **Create React Components**
6. **Set Up Server with WebSocket**
7. **Integrate Data Processing**
8. **Docker Configuration**
9. **Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
10. **Run the Project**

### Step 1: Initialize the Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it, then initialize a new Node.js project.

```bash
mkdir 16k-visualization
cd 16k-visualization
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies for React, Three.js, WebSocket, and other tools.

```bash
npm install react react-dom three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei express socket.io aws-sdk @tensorflow/tfjs
npm install -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```

### Step 3: Set Up Project Structure

Create the necessary directories for your project.

```bash
mkdir -p src/components src/utils src/styles public
```

### Step 4: Configure Webpack and Babel

Create the Webpack configuration file.

**webpack.config.js**:
```javascript
const path = require('path');
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
        },
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
};
```

Create the Babel configuration file.

**.babelrc**:
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

Create the HTML template file.

**public/index.html**:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>16K Weather Visualization</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 5: Create React Components

Create the entry point for your application.

**src/index.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './components/App';
import './styles/index.css';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Create the main App component.

**src/components/App.js**:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Visualization from './Visualization';
import CustomizationPanel from './CustomizationPanel';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>16K Weather Visualization</h1>
      <CustomizationPanel />
      <Visualization />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Create the Visualization component.

**src/components/Visualization.js**:
```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

const Visualization = () => {
  const socket = useRef(null);
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.current = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000');
    socket.current.onmessage = (message) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(message.data);
      setData(data);
    };

    return () => socket.current.close();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <OrbitControls />
      {data && data.map((point, index) => (
        <mesh key={index} position={[point.x, point.y, point.z]}>
          <sphereBufferGeometry args={[0.1, 32, 32]} />
          <meshStandardMaterial color='red' />
        </mesh>
      ))}
    </Canvas>
  );
};

export default Visualization;
```

Create the Customization Panel component.

**src/components/CustomizationPanel.js**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

const CustomizationPanel = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [colorScheme, setColorScheme] = useState('default');
  const [dataThreshold, setDataThreshold] = useState(50);
  const [animationSpeed, setAnimationSpeed] = useState(1);

  const handleColorSchemeChange = (event) => {
    setColorScheme(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_COLOR_SCHEME', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  const handleDataThresholdChange = (event) => {
    setDataThreshold(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_DATA_THRESHOLD', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  const handleAnimationSpeedChange = (event) => {
    setAnimationSpeed(event.target.value);
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_ANIMATION_SPEED', payload: event.target.value });
  };

  return (
    <div className="customization-panel">
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="color-scheme-select">Color Scheme:</label>
        <select id="color-scheme-select" value={colorScheme} onChange={handleColorSchemeChange}>
          <option value="default">Default</option>
          <option value="cool">Cool</option>
          <option value="warm">Warm</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="data-threshold-input">Data Threshold:</label>
        <input
          id="data-threshold-input"
          type="number"
          value={dataThreshold}
          onChange={handleDataThresholdChange}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="animation-speed-input">Animation Speed:</label>
        <input
          id="animation-speed-input"
          type="number"
          value={animationSpeed}
          onChange={handleAnimationSpeedChange}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomizationPanel;
```

Create the CSS file for styling.

**src/styles/index.css**:
```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.customization-panel {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.customization-panel > div {
  margin: 0 10px;
}
```

### Step 6: Set Up Server with WebSocket

Create the server file to handle WebSocket connections.

**server.js**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = requireSure, let's continue with setting up the server to handle WebSocket connections.

**server.js** (continued):
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

// Serve static files from the dist directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

// WebSocket server setup
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
    // Process incoming messages and broadcast to clients
    const data = JSON.parse(message);
    // For example, broadcasting the received data to all connected clients
    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(JSON.stringify(data));
      }
    });
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

// Start the server
server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Step 7: Integrate Data Processing

You can create a utility file for handling data processing. This file will include functions to process and transform incoming data.

**src/utils/dataProcessing.js**:
```javascript
export const processData = (data) => {
  // Implement data processing logic
  // For example, filtering, transformation, etc.
  return data.map(item => ({
    x: item.x * 0.1,
    y: item.y * 0.1,
    z: item.z * 0.1,
  }));
};
```

Update your WebSocket message handling to use the data processing utility.

**server.js** (updated):
```javascript
const { processData } = require('./src/utils/dataProcessing');

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('New client connected');

  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Received message: ${message}`);
    const data = JSON.parse(message);
    const processedData = processData(data);

    wss.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(JSON.stringify(processedData));
      }
    });
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});
```

### Step 8: Docker Configuration

Create a Dockerfile to define your Docker image.

**Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Node runtime as a parent image
FROM node:16

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 4000

# Define the command to run the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Create a Docker Compose file to define your services.

**docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
      - /usr/src/app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 9: Set Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file to automate building and deploying your application.

**.github/workflows/deploy.yml**:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Build the application
      run: npm run build

    - name: Deploy to AWS S3
      if: success()
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_REGION: 'us-east-1'
      run: |
        aws s3 sync ./dist s3://your-bucket-name --delete
```

### Step 10: Run the Project

1. **Build and Start the Project**:
   - Add scripts to your `package.json` to build and start the project.

**package.json** (updated):
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --mode production"
}
```

2. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the development server.

```bash
npm start
```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:
   - Build the Docker container.

```bash
docker-compose build
```

4. **Start the Docker Container**:
   - Start the container.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Conclusion

You should now have a fully set up project with a clear structure, WebSocket communication, data processing, Docker configuration, and CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. You can further enhance this by integrating more complex data processing and visualization techniques as needed.
